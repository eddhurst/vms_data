# VMS Data sorting
Splitting VMS data out to identify closest point to GPS tracker within a given time period either side of the GPS ping.

Assumes dataset of Longitude, Latitude and GPS ping time for both Bird Data and Boat Data. Additional data referenced and included in output, but long/lat & time is all that's critical for mission success.

If it helps anybody, do let me know, I'd be interested to know what projects you're working on.
