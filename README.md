# Sorting VMS data by GPS proximity to object

Splitting VMS data out to identify closest point to GPS tracker within a given time period either side of the GPS ping. In this case, the proximity of a bird to a boat.

Split boat dataset to only incorporate boats nearby within a given timeframe (30 mins each side of GPS ping).

Assumes dataset of Longitude, Latitude and GPS ping time for both Bird Data and Boat Data. Additional data referenced and included in output, but long/lat & time is all that's critical for mission success.

If it helps anybody, do let me know, I'd be interested to know what projects you're working on.
